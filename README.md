# Data Science Project (Terrorism Hotspots)

***

## Project Overview

This  is StrataScrach project that aims to identify and analyze terrorism hotspots around the world.
The project uses a dataset from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to identify the most affected countries
and cities, and to analyze the types of attacks and their impact.

***

### Assigment

**The project is divided into several tasks:**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is in a
suitable format for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand the distribution of
terrorism-related data and nature of terrorist incidents recorded around the world.
3. **Provide answers to the following questions**:
    - How has the number of terrorist activities changed over the years? Are there certain regions where this trend is different from the global averages?
    - Is the number of incidents and the number of casualties correlated? Can you spot any irregularities or outliers?
    - What are the most common methods of attacks? Does it differ in various regions or in time?
    - Plot the locations of attacks on a map to visualize their regional spread;
